## Installation
Download code from the GitHub repository. Have Node.js installed. Link to Node.js downloads: https://nodejs.dev/en/download/. In a terminal install inquirer version 8.2.4 by inputting npm install inquirer@8.2.4.

## Usage
Generate a README file by answering a series of prompts. It will display in order the project title, description, table of contents, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions. The README will be generated in the assets folder named REAME.md (not to be confused with this README).

If the title is left blank, the title will have template version. If a section is left blank, then it will not appear on the generated README nor will it appear on the table of contents section. The table of contents section will have a link to the respective sections for quick access. 

The user is asked a yes or no question if they want to add a photo. If yes, they will be asked to enter the file name and the photo description. If file name is left blank, the phtot will not render at all. The photo description will be defaulted to "screenshot" if the description is left blank. The photo will try to refer to the assets/images folder. The photo will not properly appear if the file does not exist in that folder or if the file does not have a valid photo type (png, jpeg, etc).  The photo will appear in the usage section regardless if the user entered anything for usage.

The license prompt is asked as a list. The list contains all the licenses that GitHub presents. The list is long, so the user may need to scroll down to find the right one. Inquirer also loops the list when it is long. There is an option for no license, but it is not recomended. The section will show the license name and then a badge that will link to the license's website. The website should provide the user with further information about the license. The badge is generated by https://shields.io/.

The questions section is comprised of the user's github profile and their email. This section serves as a contact me.
